#### Election-Audit Summary
This script is very useful and can be used for any future election. All that is required is an updated CVS file and data would be pulled quickly. With some modification the script could potentially provide a breakdown of the number of votes each candidate had from a specfic county. Or it could provide a breakdown of a specific candidate and which county had the most votes for that candidate.
